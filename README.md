My topic-I made a landing page for the band 'pink floyd'

Features implemented-I made css cards for the band members and their top albums so that people can know more about them and listen to their music if they like.I added a fotter for copyright text and social icons.I made the website responsive.
I also added a toggle bar at the top for changing the background image of the website using java script but i faced a problem which i colud not solve, the toggle bar design was visible on the vs code live server but when i hosted the website on github i could not see
the design i was only able to see a checkbox button which on cliking the background changes. I tried to correct it by using a lot of online and AI resources but i was not able to succeed.

learning resources-

1)Code with harry youtube tutorials

2)W3 school resources for html,css and js

3)the odin project

4)Tutorial videos in the webwiz group description

5)i used a bit of ChatGPT for toggleing between backgrounds part apart from that i did not use AI for anything else in the project.
